\section{Summary}
In a more congested network, P2P transfers can reduce the impact of server upload bandwidth limitations on the overall network transfer speed. But at the cost of more computation, random disk reads and writes, and additional communication overhead. In addition, P2P transport requires a well-designed set of protocols to load-balance the network's nodes. These are all challenges for designing P2P applications.
