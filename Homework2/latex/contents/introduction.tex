\section{Introduction}
In this experiment we implemented 2 simple file share applications using TCP Socket APIs. The applications are designed under the instruction of the following 2 models:
\begin{itemize}
\item C/S model: 1) Server listens to a given port; 2) Multiple clients request the same file from the server; 3) Each client save the file to its local directory.
\item P2P model: 1) Each peer downloads part of the file from the server; 2) Peers distribute it to all the other peers.

\end{itemize}
The programming language of applications is C++, and \textbf{Mininet} was used to run simulations.
